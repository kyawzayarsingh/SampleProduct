# SampleProduct

-- For DB Setup, I didn't give any SQL Server Authenticaion for database, you can simply used by creating a database and uploading the file.
Here in project repository, you will see (.sql file) named sampleProductDB.sql.
First, create the database with the name of "SampleDB" in MSSQL Server.
After that press Ctrl + O for file upload, select the sampleProductDB.sql file and then press F5 to execute and then you can run the project.
